# phd-skills

Research integrity plugin for Claude Code — paper auditing, citation
verification, experiment analysis, and methodology-first skills for
academic workflows. Supports both LaTeX and Markdown (Pandoc → .docx)
paper formats.

Built by [Fatih Cagatay Akyon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RHGyDE0AAAAJ)
(1300+ citations, 7 patents) after 200+ Claude Code sessions, tens of
critical AI mistakes caught the hard way, and thousands of hours of
PhD research. Every guardrail in this plugin traces to a real mistake.

## Why This Plugin Exists

I use Claude Code daily for my PhD. It's powerful, but it
makes research-specific mistakes that cost hours:

- It typed "done?" as "dont?" and launched an unwanted upload of thousands of files
- It analyzed my full dataset when I asked for a specific 4k/2k/2k split
- It claimed a test covered a bug it had never actually verified
- It never once looked at a figure it generated — just trusted the numbers

Other plugins give you more commands. **This plugin gives you guardrails.**

## Install

```
claude plugin marketplace add fcakyon/phd-skills
claude plugin install phd-skills@phd-skills
```

Then run `/phd-skills:setup` inside Claude Code to configure notifications, paper format (LaTeX or Pandoc), and allowlist.

---

## Usage

Open Claude Code in your paper directory, then:

- `/phd-skills:xray` — audit paper against code and data across 5 dimensions, get prioritized fixes
- `/phd-skills:factcheck` — verify all BibTeX entries and cited claims against DBLP
- `/phd-skills:fortify CVPR` — anticipate reviewer questions, rank ablations, and suggest paper improvements
- `/phd-skills:gaps neural architecture search` — find what's missing in the literature
- `/loop 30m check experiment logs, notify me if metrics beat the baseline or if loss starts to diverge`
- `"check if my numbers match the code"` — skills auto-trigger, no slash command needed
- `"make code publish ready"` — prepares code for open-source release with license, docs, and reproducibility checks

After running `/phd-skills:setup`, all Claude Code notifications (task completion,
background agents) are forwarded to your configured service (ntfy/Slack/email).

## What You Get

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [`/phd-skills:xray`](plugin/commands/xray.md) | Audit paper against code and data (5 parallel dimensions) |
| [`/phd-skills:factcheck`](plugin/commands/factcheck.md) | Verify BibTeX entries and cited claims against DBLP |
| [`/phd-skills:gaps <topic>`](plugin/commands/gaps.md) | Literature gap analysis with web confirmation |
| [`/phd-skills:fortify [venue]`](plugin/commands/fortify.md) | Select strongest ablations + anticipate reviewer questions |
| [`/phd-skills:setup`](plugin/commands/setup.md) | Interactive onboarding (notifications, allowlist, LaTeX/Pandoc) |
| [`/phd-skills:help`](plugin/commands/help.md) | Show all features at a glance |

### Skills (auto-trigger — just describe what you need)

| When you say... | Skill activates |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "design an ablation study" | [Experiment Design](plugin/skills/experiment-design/SKILL.md) |
| "find related papers on X" | [Literature Research](plugin/skills/literature-research/SKILL.md) |
| "review my methods section for consistency" | [Paper Verification](plugin/skills/paper-writing/SKILL.md) |
| "check if my numbers match the code" | [Paper Verification](plugin/skills/paper-verification/SKILL.md) |
| "analyze dataset bias" | [Dataset Curation](plugin/skills/dataset-curation/SKILL.md) |
| "prepare code for open-source release" | [Research Publishing](plugin/skills/research-publishing/SKILL.md) |
| "what will reviewers ask about this?" | [Reviewer Defense](plugin/skills/reviewer-defense/SKILL.md) |
| "setup latex for CVPR" | [LaTeX Setup](plugin/skills/latex-setup/SKILL.md) |
| "setup pandoc for markdown" | [Pandoc Setup](plugin/skills/pandoc-setup/SKILL.md) |

### Agents (Claude delegates automatically)

| Agent | What it does | Special |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| [`paper-auditor`](plugin/agents/paper-auditor.md) | Cross-checks paper claims vs code and data | Runs in isolated worktree, remembers patterns across sessions |
| [`experiment-analyzer`](plugin/agents/experiment-analyzer.md) | Analyzes results from wandb/neptune/local/any format | Can schedule monitoring via cron, sends SSH notifications |

### Research Guardrails (run silently — you never invoke these)

| What it catches | Real incident that inspired it |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| [Unverified claims, wrong targets, scope creep, dropped requests, assumptions stated as facts](plugin/hooks/hooks.json) | Claude removed introduction novelty claims, analyzed wrong data split, dropped a verification question mid-commit |
| [Ambiguous short messages before costly actions](plugin/hooks/hooks.json) | "done?" misread as "dont?", launched unwanted upload |
| [Missing citation verification when editing .tex/.bib/.md](plugin/scripts/citation_guard.sh) | Claude propagated unverified author names and venue info |
| [LaTeX compilation errors after .tex edits](plugin/scripts/latex_check.sh) | Errors compounded across multiple edits before being caught |
| [Pandoc conversion errors after .md edits](plugin/scripts/pandoc_check.sh) | Markdown formatting issues compounded across edits before being caught |
| [Unreviewed generated images/figures](plugin/scripts/visual_check.sh) | Claude analyzed metrics but never looked at the actual plots |
| [Research state loss before context overflow](plugin/scripts/save_state.sh) | Long research sessions lost context, leading to rushed conclusions |

## How It Compares

| | phd-skills | flonat/claude-research | Others |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commands to learn | 6 | 39 | 13-20 |
| Research integrity hooks | 7 (prompt + command) | 1 | 0 |
| Paper-code consistency audit | 5-dimension parallel | Read-only, no code cross-ref | None |
| Experiment monitoring + SSH notifications | Yes (ntfy/slack/email) | No | No |
| External dependencies | **None** | npm + pip + MCP servers | MCP required |
| Install time | 30 seconds | 10+ minutes | Varies |

## Design Principles

1. **No MCP dependency** — works on any machine, including SSH
2. **Methodology over scripts** — skills teach the approach, Claude generates code for your specific setup (wandb, neptune, local files, whatever)
3. **Human oversight first** — Claude makes premature claims and jumps to conclusions. Every skill builds in verification checkpoints
4. **Actionable output** — ranked suggestions with specific fixes, never just a list of findings

## License

MIT — use it, fork it, adapt it to your research.

Built with frustration and care during a PhD at METU.
